3.  Validate your settings and select **Review + Create** then **Create**.

    >**Note:** The gateway will take 30-45 minutes to provision. Rather than waiting, continue to the next task.

1.  Using the Azure Management portal, select **+ Create a resource**, type **Virtual Network gateway** in the **Search the Marketplace** text box, in the list of results, select **Virtual network gateway**, and then select **Create**.

2.  On the **Create virtual network gateway** blade,  enter the following information and select **Review + create**:

    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription**.

    -  Name: **WGVNet1Gateway**

    -  Region: This must match the location in which you created the **WGVNet1** virtual network.

    -  Gateway type: **VPN**

    -  VPN type: **Route-based**

    -  SKU: **VpnGw1**

    -  Virtual network: **WGVNet1**

    -  Resource group: **WGVNetRG1**

    -  Public IP address: **Create new**

    -  Public IP address name: **vnet1gatewayIP1**

    -  Enable active-active mode: **Enabled**

    -  Second Public IP address name: **vnet1gatewayIP2**

    -  Configure BGP: **Disabled**

3.  Validate your settings and select **Review + Create** then **Create**.

    >**Note:** The gateway will take 30-45 minutes to provision. You will need to wait until both gateways are provisioned before proceeding to the next section.

4.  The Azure portal will display a notification when the deployments have completed.

1.  In the Azure portal, select **+ Create a resource**, in the **Search the Marketplace** text box, type in **Connection**, and press **Enter**.

2.  On the **Connection** blade, select **Create**.

3.  On the **Basics** blade, leave the **Connection type** set to **VNet-to-VNet**. Select the existing **WGVNetRG1** resource group. Enter the following information and select **Next: Settings**:
    - Establish bidirectional connectivity - checked
    - First connection name - **WGVNet1-to-OnPremWGGateway**
    - Second connection name - **WGGateway-to-WGVNet1**
    - Region - **East US US or available for you**

4.  On the Settings step, select **WGVNet1Gateway** as the first virtual network gateway and **OnPremWGGateway** as the second virtual network gateway. Ensure **Establish bidirectional connectivity** and **IKEV2** is selected. Enter a shared key, such as **A1B2C3D4**. Select **Review + create**.

5.  Select **Create** on the **Summary** page to create the connection.

6.  In the Azure portal, select **All services** on the left navigation. Then, type **connections** in the search text box and select **Connections**.

7.  Watch the progress of the connection status, and use the **Refresh** icon until the status changes for both connections from **Unknown** to **Connected**. This may take 5-10 minutes or more. You might need to refresh the page to see the change in status.

1. Create a new Virtual Machine for On-premises.

1.  On the Azure portal select **All services** at the left navigation. Enter **Route** in the search box, and select **Route tables**.

2.  On the **Route tables** blade, select **+ Add**.

3.  On the **Create route table** blade, enter the following information:

    -  Subscription: **Select your subscription**.

    -  Resource group: Select the drop-down menu, and select **WGVNetRG1**.

    -  Region: This must match the location in which you created the **WGVNet1** virtual network.

    -  Name: **WGAzureVNetGWRT**

    -  Propagate gateway routes: **Yes**

4.  Select **Review + create** then **Create**.

5.  Select the **WGAzureVNetGWRT** route table.

6.  Select **Routes** under **Settings** on the left.

7.  On the **Routes** blade, select the **+ Add** button. Enter the following information, and select **OK**:

    -  Route name: **OnPremToAppSubnet**

    -  Address prefix: **10.8.0.0/25**

    -  Next hop type: **Virtual appliance**

    -  Next hop address: **10.7.1.4**

8.  On the **WGAzureVNetGWRT - Routes** blade, select **Subnets** under **Settings** on the left.

9.  On the **Subnets** blade, select **+ Associate**.

10. On the **Associate subnet** blade, select **WGVNet1** under the **Virtual Network** drop down and select **GatewaySubnet** under the **Subnet** drop down.

    >**Note:** At this point, you have configured your enterprise network. You should be able to test your Enterprise Class Network from one region to another. Your testing can include the following scenarios:

    -  On the 'on-premises' virtual machine (OnPremVM), attempt to initiate a Remote Desktop session to any virtual machine on the AppSubnet (10.8.0.0/25). Note that this should fail since it is blocked by Azure Firewall.

    -  In the Azure portal, navigate to the WGWEB1 VM and initiate a Bastion connection session to the WGWEB1 virtual machine by selecting **Connect** and **Bastion**. This should be successful since it is allowed by Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion Host. 

    -  In the Azure portal, navigate to the WGWEB1 VM and initiate a Bastion connection session to the WGWEB2 virtual machine by selecting **Connect** and **Bastion**. This should be successful since it is allowed by Azure Firewall and Azure Bastion Host. 

    -  From within the WGWEB1 VM Bastion connection session, initiate a Remote Desktop session to the WGSQL1 via its private IP address (10.8.1.4). This should be successful since it is allowed by Azure Firewall.

## Project - Deploy Hub-spoke Archicture (60 minutes)

Implement a Hub-spoke topology

   ![Screenshot of the Hub-spoke](/AllFiles/Images/Hub-Spoke.png)

**Important Notes**
- Three Virtual Networks;
- VNET Peering connection Hub and Spokes;
- Gateway VPN on the Hub network and On-premises network;
- Azure Bastion on the Hub network;
- Azure Firewall on the Hub network;
- Custom Route tables to address prefix "Address Space networking destination" and next hop type to virtual applicance;
- Network rule Azure Firewall all internal traffic.

## After the Hands-on lab 

1. Delete all Azure resources created in support of this Hands-on lab.

1. End of **Workshop Day**

1. Continue in the **Mentoria Arquiteto Cloud**.
